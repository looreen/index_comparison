# Comparison of two indices - Python learning notebook

This repository is mainly for a data analysis of two indices that I analyse for similiarities and differences. The main purpose is to practice the libraries NumPy and Pandas. 

I tried the following things, from "Python for Data Science":
- Merging
- Indexing
- Fancy Indexing
- Sorting 
- Ufuncs

- Simple graphs 

I am still missing: 
- Slicing 
- Splitting 
- Reshaping and concatening 
- Broadcasting
